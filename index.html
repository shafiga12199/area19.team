            <h2>By: Maryam Mirili</h2>
            <p>None of us had in mind that we would have to be responsible for someone other than ourselves. However, life is unpredictable. So, the day we received the homework assignment, we created a Spike Group to chat with team members, with whom we have nothing in common but two more team assignments.Of course, we had disagreements, in fact we still do. However, that is not the point. Moving on you will find out how Shafiga found school where we would finally remove one of the stones from our shoulders.!</p>

            <h2>By: Shafiga Alakbarli</h2>
            <p>At first, the team struggled to find a school because we wanted to run the presentation precisely with a refugee school. Eventually, I found such a type of school and even made an arrangement with the form-master in Fuzuli (Karabakh) Secondary School No.49. Unfortunately, there was a time conflict with that class, due to which the meeting was cancelled. Over a few days of searching, another school was found and  a suitable class from Baku School-Lyceum No.299 for conducting an event.</p>

            <h2>By: Nazrin Gismatli</h2>
            <p>On the set day of our presentation, all the pupils joined our team, and the meeting started. As it was planned, we all introduced ourselves and where we came from. Polad Bakhishzade made a brief overview regarding ADA University and, in particular, our faculty. Next, Nazrin Gismatli, taking the duty of a tutor, began giving information about code.org and its puzzles. Whilst she was tutoring the students, the other team members were taking notes, looking after the students' overall progress and, in case of possible questions, were answering and filling up the potential gaps in mind of students.</p>

              <h2>....</h2>
              <p>At the end of the meeting, the pupils were asked a few questions, including their perception about the course, whether they took similar ones before. According to what they said, it was their first time when they were taught such type of courses, and, generally, they enjoyed the presentation. Moreover, we hope that we could encourage at least some of them to get deeper knowledge in coding and informatics overall in the future.</p>

            <p>Of course, just like any other homework this one was particularly surprising. Since building a website is quite an interesting and terrifying field at the same time, our thoughts were controversial. However, with proper planning and individual contribution of team members, the website and other files will be submitted before the deadline. Considering the fact that most of us have loads of homeworks and finals coming up, this is not an easy task to accomplish. As any other student would understand: the last attempt to grasp the choice has been taken away from us. Utterly and inevitably obliged to complete all the tasks, we are smoothly moving to completion of the assignment and submitting it prior 28th of January.!</p>

            <p>Our robotics project's deadline is quite comfortable at the moment. Of course, it will be hard to code a program without using the actual robot (compiler). But Dr. Yusubov said that programmers did the same in the 90s. Since I always considered the past more alluring than the future, we will code the program and the robot will do fine. Until then homework 3 should be submitted.!</p>
